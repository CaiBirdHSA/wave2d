# Wave2d

Wave2d is a very simple Python code to investigate a few properties of
linear waves encountered in fluids: surface waves, internal gravity
waves and Rossby waves.  The code illustrates their dispersive effects
through the evolution of the wave field. The code offers three
different ways to generate waves: a localized initial
perturbation, a moving object, generating a wake, and an oscillating
wavemaker. The code also illustrates two aspects of the wave energy:
injection or conservation, depending on the generation mechanism, and
propagation in space. This last aspect is so central that it could be
almost the definition of a wave: a wave is a process able to transport
energy with negligible mass transport (quote from R. Feynman).
